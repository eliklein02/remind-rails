  <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> 05/07/2025</p>

  <p><strong>Remind</strong> ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect personal information when you receive messages through our school-based communication service.</p>

  <h2>Our Service</h2>
  <p>We provide a messaging platform that enables schools to send important alerts and updates to parents, guardians, and staff. These alerts are sent via SMS or MMS to contact lists managed directly by the school or its authorized representatives.</p>

  <h2>Message Frequency and Content</h2>
  <p>Messages may include schedule changes, simchas, reminders, or other school-related notifications. Message frequency will vary based on school needs.</p>

  <h2>How to Opt In</h2>
  <p>By providing your phone number to a school participating in our service, you are consenting to receive SMS/MMS alerts. You may also opt in directly by texting <strong>START</strong> to +15166967451.</p>

  <h2>How to Get Help</h2>
  <p>To get help or more information, text <strong>HELP</strong> to +15166967451 or contact us at <a href="mailto:[Insert Email]">eliklein02@gmail.com</a>.</p>

  <h2>How to Opt Out</h2>
  <p>You may opt out at any time by texting <strong>STOP</strong> to +15166967451. After you send STOP, you will no longer receive SMS alerts from us unless you re-enroll by texting START again.</p>

  <h2>Data Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>We collect and process only the personal information necessary to deliver messages, such as your phone number and any information provided by your school. This data is used solely to send communications on behalf of the school and is not shared with third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>We do not sell or rent your personal information. Information may be shared only with the school or district managing the contact list and only for the purpose of providing the messaging service.</p>

  <h2>Security</h2>
  <p>We implement industry-standard security measures to protect your data from unauthorized access or disclosure.</p>

  <h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2>
  <p>Our service is intended for use by schools to communicate with adults (e.g., parents and guardians). It is not intended to collect personal data directly from children under 13.</p>
